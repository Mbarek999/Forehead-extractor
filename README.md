Forehead Extractor
A lightweight, real-time forehead region extractor using classical computer vision techniques.

This C++ application uses OpenCV to detect and extract the forehead region from a live webcam feed — entirely without any machine learning or AI models.

✨ Features
📷 Real-time forehead detection from webcam input

🧠 No AI or machine learning dependencies

🟦 Edge detection using Sobel filters

🔍 Contour-based region identification

🖼 ROI (Region of Interest) extraction with tunable parameters

💡 Optimized for performance on low-power systems

🔧 Requirements
OpenCV 4.x

C++17 compatible compiler

Webcam

🚀 Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Mbarek999/Forehead-extractor.git
cd Forehead-extractor
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
▶️ Usage
bash
Copy
Edit
./forehead_extractor
The program will start capturing from your webcam and highlight the detected forehead region in real time.

🎯 Motivation
Most facial region extractors rely on machine learning models (e.g., Haar cascades, deep neural networks).
This project demonstrates that classical computer vision techniques are still powerful and efficient for targeted tasks — offering faster performance and easier deployment.
